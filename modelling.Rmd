In this section, I will make a model to predict the presence of polycystic ovary syndrom (PCOS). 

As a first step, I will revise the variables that we have and remove the ones that I consider irrelevant. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)

load(here("data.Rdata"))

colnames(data)

```

Looking at the variables, I would like to build a data-driven model so that I don't remove variables that could have predictive power in my analysis because of lack of investigation in the field. However, there's one variable that I do not consider right to include 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
